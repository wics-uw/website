Summary: Join us for tea and for information on volunteering with us!

Welcome back! You're cordially invited to our Tea Party and Volunteer meeting.
Come out to socialize with some WiCS members, meet the new committee, and learn
more about our volunteer opportunities! The volunteer meeting will run from
5:00 - 5:30, and the Tea Party will go from 5:30 to 7:00. If you just want to
come for the tea party, feel free to come by at 5:30. Please try to bring your
own mug if possible.

Note: Although our volunteer meeting is open to everyone, our Tea Party is
a Big CSters event is and is thus [women-only](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/faq).
