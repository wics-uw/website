Summary: A casual day of fun and work!

Come out for a fun day of coding with fellow students in CS! Work on that
project you've been wanting to work on, keep grinding on the assignment that's
due soon, study with friends, or hang out and socialize with people!

We'll be providing lunch, snacks (vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options will
 be available) and some ideas of things you can work on. All levels of
programmers welcome!
