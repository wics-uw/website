Summary: Come out to hear Stephanie Morillo talk about her experiences in the tech world!

WiCS Undergrad is proud to invite Stephanie Morillo as our out-of-town speaker
this term! Stephanie will be joining us on March 21st to give a talk entitled:
“Circuit Breaker: How My Love For Writing Brought Me To Tech.”

Abstract: The road to a successful career in tech wasn’t forged back in 
university; it was forged in my mid-twenties when I was unemployed and learned to program on a 
friend’s couch. After spending my first postgraduate years as a communications
professional, I discovered the power of programming and with it, the exciting 
and often frustrating realities of working in tech: the ability to interact 
with people in the greater tech community, the chance to get exposed to new
technologies, and the dearth of talent from underrepresented groups. In my 
talk, I’ll recount my journey into tech, the observations I’ve made, and the 
lessons I’ve learned that I wish I could tell my university-aged self about 
what it means to be successful, and how to dismantle limiting beliefs before 
finding one’s first job.
