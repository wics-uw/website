Summary: Come out to hear Stephanie Morillo talk about her experiences in the tech world!

WiCS Undergrad is proud to invite Stephanie Morillo as our out-of-town speaker
this term! Stephanie will be joining us on March 21st to give a talk entitled:
“Circuit Breaker: How My Love For Writing Brought Me To Tech.”

Abstract: The road to a successful career in tech wasn’t forged back in 
university; it was forged in my mid-twenties when I was unemployed and I
learned to program on a friend’s couch. After spending my first postgraduate
years as a communications professional, I discovered the power of programming
and with it, the exciting and often frustrating realities of working in tech:
the ability to interact with people in the greater tech community, the chance
to get exposed to new technologies, and the dearth of talent from 
underrepresented groups. In my talk, I’ll recount my journey into tech, 
the observations I’ve made, and the lessons I’ve learned that I wish I could 
tell my university-aged self about what it means to be successful, and how to 
dismantle limiting beliefs before finding one’s first job.
