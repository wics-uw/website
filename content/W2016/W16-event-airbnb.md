Summary: Hang out with some cool people from Airbnb while trying to escape some rooms!

Have you been wondering what those “escape room” things everyone’s been talking
about lately are? Come find out with WiCS and Airbnb!

We’re going out to Adventure Rooms Canada to try it for ourselves, and maybe
beat a record while we’re there.

This event has limited attendance so [register soon](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1v7OqMeQ0QI6RHETIIEA7VgoUeUm3VT7m0QbP0fPUtQM/viewform)!

for some people, including being handcuffed (for a short period of time) and
being in a small space with 15-20 other people.
