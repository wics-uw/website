Summary: Join us for a fun workshop to learn the basics of Git, Github and open source contributions!

What is Git? Why are people always telling me to make branches? How does one 
contribute to an open-source project? We’ll be answering all these questions
and more at our Intro to Git and Open Source Software Workshop! Fatema will
explain the basics of Git, and by the end of the workshop all participants will
have submitted a pull request to a public repository. Upper year mentors will
be around to answer questions and dinner will be provided!

This workshop is recommended for beginners, and you can view the repo we’ll be working
