Title: Machine Usage Agreement
Category: pages
Status: hidden
Slug: machine-usage


Everyone provided an account on one of the WiCS machines must sign the
agreement in the final section. While guest account users on our office
terminals are not required to sign this document, they are subject to the same
rules and regulations and will be held responsible for their actions should an
issue arise. This document does not state who will be allowed accounts on WiCS
machines, the normal expiry period of accounts, nor any other similar matters.
Further, this policy does not, in general, guarantee any rights to users.

Additional policies for group accounts and administrative accounts are not yet
available. There is also a brief [summary of the usage
policy]({filename}/pages/mua-summary.md) available.

# Usage Policy #

The usage policy is divided into the following sections:

+ Acceptable and Unacceptable Use
+ User Responsibilities
+ Security
+ Auditing and Logging
+ Rights of the Systems Committee and the WiCS Committee

Note that in the following sections, the term "user" implies a user of a WiCS
machine, unless otherwise specified.

## Acceptable and Unacceptable Use ##

The WiCS machines are intended for learning, personal projects, and general use
in accordance with [the aims of WiCS]({filename}/pages/about.md). Projects of
interest may be given special priority by the WiCS Systems Committee
("wics-sys").

Users must adhere to WiCS' policies concerning machine usage.

## User Responsibilities ##

Users are responsible for any activity on their own accounts. Users, and not
WiCS, will be held accountable for any of their illegal, damaging or unethical
actions. Such actions are not permitted on WiCS machines, and all machine usage
is governed by our [Code of Conduct]({filename}/pages/code-of-conduct.md).
Additionally, all users are governed by this machine usage agreement, local
laws, and University policy.

Users must act responsibly, and the needs of others with regard to computing
resources must be considered at all times. In particular, no user should use
any resource to an extent that other users are prevented from similarly using
that resource, and no user's actions shall disrupt the work of other users.

Users must also abide by the usage policies of all machines that they connect
to from WiCS machines, or use to connect to WiCS machines. It is the users'
responsibility to check the policies of all machines that they connect to.

## Security ##

On WiCS machines, users are only permitted access to their own personal
accounts. In particular, users may not attempt to gain access to other
accounts, attempt to access other users' private files, nor may they attempt to
obtain the password of any account other than their own.

While the WiCS System Committee works on a best effort basis to ensure machines
are kept secure and user privacy is maintained, wics-sys offers **no
guarantee** of privacy. It is a good practice to treat all data stored on our
machines as public.

An account may only be used by the person assigned to it. Users are not
permitted to share passwords with anybody, or let anyone else use their
accounts. Users should consider the security implications of their actions. For
example:

+ Passwords for accounts on WiCS machines should not be used on other machines
+ No machines should be granted automatic access to WiCS accounts (e.g. via
  .rhosts files).

The appropriate members of the Systems Committee [must be notified
immediately](mailto:wics-sys@lists.uwaterloo.ca) in the event that a security
problem is found. The problem should neither be exploited nor made public until
it can be corrected.

## Auditing and Logging ##

The WiCS Systems Committee keeps records ("logs") on our machines to

## Rights of the Systems Committee and the WiCS Executive ##

The WiCS Systems Committee may examine any files or programs believed to be
consuming excessive resources or in violation of the usage policies for the
WiCS network. Examination of a program includes examination of the running
process and its binary. Files believed to be the data or source to the process
may also be examined. The process may be killed, stopped or otherwise
interrupted at the discretion of the Systems Committee. If the Systems
Committee takes any of the above actions, the owner of the process will be
notified.

The Systems Committee may at any time revoke a user's permission to access an
account provided that a written (possibly electronic) explanation is given.
Cause for removal of access to an account includes, but is not limited to,
violation of the machine usage policy, violation of University policy, or
violation of the law. In the event of a dispute, a user whose account has been
revoked may appeal to the WiCS Committee for its reinstatement.

The WiCS Committee has the right to update any policy, including this one, with
reasonable notice.

# User Agreement #

I have read and understood the usage policy of 20 February 2015, and I agree to
use my account on the WiCS network in accordance with this policy. I am
responsible for all actions taken by anyone using this account. Furthermore, I
accept full legal responsibility for all of the actions that I commit using the
WiCS network according to any and all applicable laws.

I understand that with little or no notice machines on the WiCS network and
resources on these machines may become unavailable. Machines may be halted
while users are using them, and I will not hold the WiCS responsible for lost
time or data.
