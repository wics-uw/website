Title: MUA Summary
Status: hidden

Anyone with a user account on a WiCS machine must sign our [Machine Usage
Agreement]({filename}/pages/mua.md), summarized below. Those using available
guest accounts do not need to sign the MUA, but they are still held to the
rules and regulations outlined in it.

## Acceptable and Unacceptable Use ##

- Accounts should primarily be used for academic study or personal computing
  projects
- Users shall not engage in unethical, abusive, illegal, or damaging activities

## User Responsibilities ##

- User conduct, whether you have an account or are a guest user, is governed by
  our [Code of Conduct]({filename}/pages/code-of-conduct.md),
  [MUA]({filename}/pages/mua.md), local laws, and University policy
- In particular, this means **no commercial use**: no corporate or startup
  websites or product work, no mining cryptocurrency
- Users are responsible for all usage of their account and their actions

## Security ##

- WiCS provides no guarantees of security
- Users are only permitted to access their own accounts; do NOT share your
  account or password

  Committee](mailto:wics-sys@lists.uwaterloo.ca) immediately and do not make it
  public until it is corrected or attempt to exploit it

## Auditing and Logging ##

- We log your activity
- We may share these logs with the University or local law enforcement when
  required

## Rights of the Systems Committee and the WiCS Executive ##

- When necessary, we will examine programs, files, or software that appear to
  violate policy or our systems security and may terminate or remove them with
  notice

- We may update this and other policies, with notice
