# Mailing Lists #

If you are a female student enrolled in a computer science program (CS, SE,
Bioinformatics, CS DD, etc.), you are automatically subscribed to the
[cs-female-undergrads](https://lists.uwaterloo.ca/mailman/listinfo/cs-female-undergrads)
mailing list at the beginning of each term. It is not possible to subscribe to
this list if you are not already a member. This list has approximately 600
members&mdash;wow!

If you're not a member of cs-female-undergrads and would like to hear from us,
you can join our
[wics-announce](https://lists.uwaterloo.ca/mailman/listinfo/wics-announce)
mailing list.

desk space. We will publish our office hours on [the
