Title: Using Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
Category: pages
Status: hidden
Slug: irc

The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee uses a public [Internet
Relay Chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC) channel
to chat, plan events, and hold discussions. If you've never used IRC before,
this document is designed to help you get set up.

Our public IRC channel, #wics, is located on the Open and Free Technology
Community (OFTC) network. We also have a separate channel for our systems
commitee, #wics-sys. You can visit us by connecting to
[irc.oftc.net](http://www.oftc.net/) or using our webchat, as detailed below.

**Note:** All conversations in the channel are logged for future reference, but
we do not publish our logs. Communication in the channel is governed by our
[Code of Conduct]({filename}/pages/code-of-conduct.md). If you haven't given it
a read yet, please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with it!

# Installation instructions #

## Web ##

If you just want to drop by our channel to see what all the fuss is about, it's
as easy as clicking a link  to join us via a web chat client. You can join our
general channel, [#wics](http://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=wics), or our
systems committee channel,
[#wics-sys](http://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=wics-sys), in this way. Simply
choose a username and click "Connect"!

## Graphical clients ##

Follow these instructions on the OpenHatch wiki to download and install an IRC
client:

+ [Windows](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum/Laptop_setup/Windows_IRC)
+ [OS X](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum/Laptop_setup/OSX_IRC)
+ [Linux](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum/Laptop_setup/Linux_IRC)

Our connection information differs from the OpenHatch wiki. Please use the
following parameters:

**Server name:** OFTC (Open and Free Technology Community)<br>
**Channel name:** #wics

## Persistent sessions ##

Many of our users have an IRC session online at all times. If you'd like to
use a similar setup, you will need access to a Linux server.

[IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) is a user-friendly and feature rich
graphical client that supports persistent sessions, file and image sharing, and
more through web and mobile clients. However, it costs $5 USD/month for
persistent sessions. If you're looking for a more modern take on IRC that
includes a mobile application with out-of-the-box push notifications and you're
not worried about the small cost, this may be a great choice for you.

For a more traditional setup, you can [follow these
instructions](http://wiki.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/How_to_IRC) to configure IRC in a
screen session on a remote server, allowing you to use a secure shell to log in
and view your session at any time.

The instructions above are aimed at Computer Science Club members, who have
login credentials for `taurine.csclub.uwaterloo.ca`. Unfortunately, at this
time, WiCS does not offer community logins. We hope to have a server set up in
the near future to provide this service. In the meantime, University of
Waterloo students, staff, and alumni can purchase a
[Computer Science Club](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca) membership for $2 per
term, which grants you access to the CSC network.
