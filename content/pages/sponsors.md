Occasionally companies will help us run events by providing us with funding, currently we are working
on the following projects:


## Technical Workshop Series 
#### Brought to you in partnership with ![BlackBerry](/images/bb_logo.jpg)

Currently we are running a Technical Workshop Series, which will consist of three
technical skills workshops over the next three terms.

These events are generously sponsored by [BlackBerry](http://ca.blackberry.com)!
BlackBerry has agreed to fund our three events and we are very excited to 
work with them!

Arduino Workshop, and we plan on running one more this term.
