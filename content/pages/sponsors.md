During the 2015-2016 academic year, we ran a Technical Workshop Series, which
consisted of three technical skills workshops over three terms. The events we
ran were:

- [Arduino Workshop](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/2015/10/arduino-workshop-F15/) in
  Fall 2015
- [Intro to Git and Open Source
  Software](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/2016/03/git-workshop-w16/) in Winter 2016
- [Machine Learning
  Workshop](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/2016/06/machine-learning-bb-s16/) in Spring
2016

These events were generously sponsored by
