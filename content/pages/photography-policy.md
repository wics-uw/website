## Enforcing the Photography Policy ##

We often take pictures at events, but not without consent.
We will not take your picture if you're wearing a lanyard (we keep
some lanyards available at all our events) or if you request that we
don't take your picture. We will review the photography policy at the
beginning of every event we run. 

## How Photographs Are Used ##

We can use these pictures for our social media profiles (Facebook,
Twitter etc.) and also for our publicity material like brochures.
Photos taken will be posted to social media unless you
specifically ask otherwise or are wearing a lanyard.

**Note:** While we do our best to maintain control of the photos we
take, we cannot guarantee that photos will not be stolen/used by other
organizations.
