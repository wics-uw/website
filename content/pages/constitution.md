# I. Structure of Organization #

The &ldquo;Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee&rdquo; is a
subcommittee of the Women in Computer Science Committee, a standing committee
of the Cheriton School of Computer Science. For the remainder of this document,
this standing committee will be referred to as the "WiCS Committee". All
references to: &ldquo;the undergraduate committee&rdquo;, &ldquo;the
committee&rdquo;, and &ldquo;committee members&rdquo; refer to the
Undergraduate Committee unless otherwise specified.

## i. Purpose and Vision ##

The undergraduate committee aims to foster a safe environment for cis and trans
women and non-binary individuals in computer science, and to advocate for the
inclusion of these underrepresented groups in the computer science community at
large.

## ii. Representation ##

The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee aims to represent and
support undergraduate cis and trans women and non-binary individuals enrolled
in computer science and related undergraduate programs at the University of
Waterloo. Additionally, we seek to include and support members of all
underrepresented groups in the fields of technology and computing, with the
most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

## iii. Values ##

1. *Inclusiveness*: The undergraduate commitee is committed to fostering an
   inclusive environment in which women of all backgrounds will feel welcome,
   and to which they can contribute.

2. *Humility*: The committee will acknowledge and respect the perspectives of
   those with experiences different to ours, and will strive to understand and
   incorporate these perspectives.

3. *Respect*: All members of the community will be treated with respect,
   regardless of difference in opinions and values.

4. *Transparency*: As leaders, our actions and decision-making must be visible
   to promote accountability, and all decision-making will be open and
   well-documented within the committee and with the public when possible.

5. *Honesty*: The committee will foster an environment to promote honest
   disclosure. All community members should feel free to voice their opinions
   and feelings. We acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes: honest disclosure
   and taking responsibility will always be supported.

6. *Technical Excellence*: The committee acknowledges that its fundamental goal
   is to support diversity in technical work, and members will strive to achieve
   excellence in this work themselves.

The Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines expected behaviour for all members of the
community at any community venues, online and in-person, and in any
communications pertaining to committee business. Any member of the committee
may propose an amendment to the CoC.

### 2. Machine Usage Agreement ###
The Machine Usage Agreement outlines expected conduct when using any machines
maintained by the undergraduate committee. Any proposed changes must be first
ratified by the Systems Committee, followed by the entire committee.

### 3. Office Policy ###
The Office Policy outlines expected behaviour in the WiCS Undergraduate
Committee office, M3 1003.

## ii. Succession Procedures ##

1.  No later than the last day of classes of the current term, a call for
    new committee members for the upcoming term shall be announced on the
    website and sent out to all affiliated mailing lists.

2.  New volunteers can apply to be on the committee for the following term, and
    the current committee will select applicants for interviews. A *new
    volunteer* shall be any individual who has never served on the committee
    before, or has not served on the committee in the past four terms.

    Interviewers should be chosen by the current committee, and are expected to
    disclose any conflicts of interest when presented with the list of
    candidates. If a conflict of interest arises, an alternate interviewer shall
    be chosen. In any case, if no interviewer is explicitly chosen and there is
    no conflict of interest, the current Chair shall conduct the interviews.

    Interviews are intended to welcome the new member to the committee, give
    them background on the committee's activities, and help them find a role for
    the next term. The current committee will ultimately select the comoposition
    of the committee for next term.

3.  *Returning committee members,* who have served on the committee within the
    past four terms, can nominate themselves for positions on the next term's
    committee given the following conditions:

    1. No member may serve more than three consecutive terms;

    2. No member may serve as Chair for more than one term consecutively;

    3. No member intending to serve as Chair or Secretary may be on co-op;

    4. Members wishing to nominate themselves for chair should be a previous
       WiCS committee member. If no such volunteer exists, the position opens
       up to new members;

    5. Excluding that of Chair, no positions may be chosen until the first
       official meeting of the new term's committee;

    6. Existing committee members may compose no more than 75% of the new
       committee, if more existing members are nominated than 75% can
       accomodate, each returning member will submit a new application to be
       reviewed by the serving Chair of the WiCS Committee.

4.  If there are any objections to an applicant, this procedure should
    be followed:

    1. The objection will be presented to the committee, with accompanying
       evidence;

    2. The individual in question may present a defense;

    3. The current committee will vote on accepting the individual for the
       upcoming term. If a majority of members uphold the objection, the
       individual will be denied a position on the next term's committee and
       must apply in the future as a new volunteer. Otherwise, they will be
       accepted as a returning member.

    4. An objection can be raised privately to the Chair or Secretary, who will
       bring the case to the committee and determine if the objection requires
       investigation under the the Code of Conduct.
