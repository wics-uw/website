# Structure of Organization #

The &ldquo;Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee&rdquo; is a
subcommittee of the Women in Computer Science Committee, a standing committee 
of the Cheriton School of Computer Science. For the remainder of this document,
this standing committee will be referred to as the "WiCS Committee". All
references to: &ldquo;the undergraduate committee&rdquo;, &ldquo;the committee&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;committee members&rdquo; refer to the Undergraduate Committee unless
otherwise specified.

## Purpose and Vision ##

The undergraduate committee aims to foster a safe environment for cis
and trans women and non-binary individuals in computer science,
and to advocate for the inclusion of these underrepresented groups in the
computer science community at large.

## Representation ##

The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee aims to
represent and support undergraduate cis and trans women, and non-binary
individuals enrolled in computer science and related undergraduate programs 
at the University of Waterloo. Additionally, we seek to include and support
members of all underrepresented groups in the fields of technology and 
computing, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

## Values ##

1.  *Inclusiveness*: The undergraduate commitee is committed to fostering
    an inclusive environment in which women of all backgrounds will
    feel welcome, and to which they can contribute.

2.  *Humility*: The committee will acknowledge and
    respect the perspectives of those with experiences different to
    ours, and will strive to understand and incorporate these
    perspectives.

3.  *Respect*: All members of the community will be treated with respect, regardless of
    difference in opinions and values.

4.  *Transparency*: As leaders, our actions and decision-making must be visible to
    promote accountability, and all decision-making will be open and
    well-documented within the committee and with the public when possible.

5.  *Honesty*: The committee will foster an environment to promote honest
    disclosure. All community members should feel free to voice their opinions and feelings. 
    We acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes: honest disclosure and taking responsibility
    will always be supported.

6.  *Technical Excellence*: The committee acknowledges that its
    fundamental goal is to support diversity in technical work, and
    members will strive to achieve excellence in this work themselves.

notice, and ratified at an official meeting of the undergraduate
committee.

### Code of Conduct ###

    the community at any community venues, online and in-person, and in 
    any communications pertaining to committee business. Any member of 
    the committee may prpose an amendment to the CoC. The committee must
    ratify any proposed amendments to the Code of Conduct.

### Machine Usage Agreement ###
    The Machine Usage Agreement outlines expected conduct when using any
    machines maintained by the undergraduate committee. Any
    proposed changes must be first ratified by the Systems Committee, 
    followed by the entire committee.

### Office Policy ###
    Office Policy outlines expected behaviour in the WiCS Undergraduate
    Committee office, M3 1003. Any proposed changes must be ratified by the
    committee.

## Succession Procedures ##

1.  No later than the last day of classes of current term, a call for 
    committee members for the upcoming term shall be announced on the
    website and sent out to all affiliated mailing lists.

2.  New volunteers can apply to be on the committee for the following
    term, and the current committee will select applicants for
    interviews. A new volunteer shall be anyone who has never served on
    the committee before, or has not served on the committee for 4 or
    more terms. Interviewers should be chosen by the current committee.
    If an interviewer has a conflict of interest with the interviewee,
    an alternate interviewer will be chosen. In any case, if no
    interviewer is explicitly chosen, the current Chair shall conduct
    interviews. The interviews are intended to welcome the new member to
    the committee, give them background on the committee's activities,
    and help them find a role for the next term. The current committee
    will ultimately select the comoposition of the committee for next
    term.

3.  Existing committee members can nominate themselves for positions on
    the next term's committee given the following conditions:

    -   No member may serve more than three consecutive terms;

    -   No member may serve as Chair for more than one term
        consecutively;

    -   No member intending to serve as Chair or Secretary may be on
        co-op;

    -   Members wishing to nominate themselves for chair should be a
        previous WiCS committee member. If no such volunteer exists, the
        position opens up to new members;

    -   Excluding that of Chair, no positions may be chosen until the
        first official meeting of the new term's committee;

    -   Existing committee members may compose no more than 75% of the
        new committee, if more existing members are nominated than 75%
        can accomodate, each returning member will submit a new
        application to be reviewed by the serving Chair of the WiCS
        Committee.

4.  If there are any objections to an applicant, this procedure should
    be followed:

    1.  The objection will be presented to the committee, with
        sufficient evidence;

    2.  The person being objected to may present a defense;

    3.  The current committee will then take a vote, if a majority of
        members agree with the objection, the objected person will be
        denied a position on the committee.

    If the objection is a sensitive concern, it can be brought up to the
    Chair or Secretary, where they will decide whether to bring the case
    to the committee and how to proceed. Otherwise, the objected person
    will be automatically accepted for the next term.

5.  Once the committee has been chosen, the Director of the WiCS
    Committee must ratify the new committeee.
