Summary: Join WiCS for our second Dinner with the Professors event!

Come have dinner with the brilliant women who are professors at Waterloo! This
is a wonderful opportunity to learn about their research, academia, teaching,
and your own academic interests. 

Note: Tickets for students are sold for $10 in MathSoc, until Wednesday, March
1. Registration for professors and for grad students who are interested in
attending as mentors is free and available [here](goo.gl/B8PQHL). Registration
is required and is first-come first-serve. If you can   not make it to the
MathSoc office in-person, please email us at [*wics-ugrad@lists.uwaterloo.ca*](mailto:wics-ugrad@lists.uwaterloo.ca) to
find   a workaround.
