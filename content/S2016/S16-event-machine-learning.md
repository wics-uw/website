Summary: Join us to get some hands-on experience with machine learning!

What is machine learning? How do computers make decisions? How do they 
organize and learn from data? What kind of algorithms are common in 
machine learning? Akshaya and Evy are holding an introductory workshop 
to machine learning where you will get to learn all these things, 
program your own machine learning algorithms, and watch them in action!

This workshop doesn't require much prior experience, but you should be 
comfortable programming basic algorithms (using for loops, if/else, etc). 
We'll be using JavaScript, but upper year mentors will be around to 
answer questions, so don't worry if you've never programmed in 
JavaScript before!

Space for the workshop is limited so make sure to [register soon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/machine-learning-tech-workshop-tickets-25891397868)!
