Summary: Join us to discuss the results of the WiCS undergrad survey.

Last winter, a survey was held for female undergraduate students in 
computer science to gather feedback about their experience in computer 
science at the university. WiCS is holding an info-session on 
the results of the survey similar to the one held last term. Join 
us to discuss the results and share your thoughts. Your feedback is 
valuable and greatly appreciated.
