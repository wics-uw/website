Summary: Join us for an interactive workshop on technical speaking!

This event is an opportunity to level up on technical public speaking skills in a welcoming environment, get constructive feedback, and engage in new and interesting topics.

No experience or preparation is required. You'll be getting into small groups and talking about side projects, coop work, or even something you learned in class that morning!

As always, dinner will be provided (with vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options).
