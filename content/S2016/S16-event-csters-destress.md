Summary: Join us for a relaxing night of socializing and de-stressing.

WiCS is collaborating with [FemPhys](https://www.facebook.com/groups/705741329511034/?fref=nf) 
to bring you a de-stressing session! We know school can be pretty stressful sometimes, 
so hopefully you can take an opportunity to take a breather and de-stress with us for 
a couple hours.

There will be a variety of activities including making face-masks, colouring,
discussion circles, and more (if you are interested in making face masks, 
we suggest bringing a small container if possible). 

As always, food will be provided! (With vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options.)

Note: This event is [women-only](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/faq).
