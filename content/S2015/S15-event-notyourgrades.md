summary: Big CSters convenes for a discussion circle around the topics of self-worth and academic achievement.

This time, we will be discussing the importance of, or lack thereof, grades in
the school system. We have all had the feeling that the grades assigned to us
determine how smart we are and what we are capable of. Even though we've always
been taught that this is the case, we should be aware that our success is not
determined solely by a number. There will be FOOD. Come out and meet your
fellow CSters!

**About Big CSters:** Our Big CSters program helps connect cis &amp; trans
