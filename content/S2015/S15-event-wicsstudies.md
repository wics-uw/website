Summary: Drop in for a day of studying and chilling with WiCS!

We may not want to admit it, but exams are right around the corner. Studying for
finals can be super stressful, especially when you're doing it all alone in the
library. Take a break from the hardcore study sesh and come work with other
WiCS! We have booked QNC 1502 (a nice big room with outlets) where you can come
to study all day. There will be snacks and coffee and upper-year students with
experience who you can ask for help. This is a 
[women-only](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/faq/) event.

**About Big CSters:** Our Big CSters program helps connect cis &amp; trans
women and non-binary students in computer science and related fields, through
events geared towards mentorship and community-building.
