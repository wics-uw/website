Summary: BigCSters convenes for a discussion circle around the topics of self-worth and academic achievement. 

This time, we will be discussing the importance of, or lack thereof,  
grades in the school system. We have all had the feeling that the  
grades assigned to us determine how smart we are and what we are  
capable of. Even though we?ve always been taught that this is the  
case, we should be aware that our success is not determined solely by  
a number. FOOD?. Come out and meet your fellow CSters!

**About Big CSters:** Our Big CSters program helps connect cis &amp; trans
women and non-binary students in computer science and related fields, through
