Summary: Join us for a Google Engineer's Career Talk!

Over the course of the past 15 years, Melissa Dominguez has worked at a variety of different types of jobs:
She's worked at software companies varying in size and age from a 30 person startup to IBM. She's worked at a non-software focused company, where software was still a product, but a secondary one, and at a hardware company. She's even explored academia (PhD + postdoc). 

She will talk about the lessons she's learned from each of these positions, the things she liked and disliked about each, and what 'success' means to her.
