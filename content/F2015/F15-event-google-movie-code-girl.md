Summary: WiCS and Google presents a documentary screening of CodeGirl

Google and WiCS are inviting you to join us for a screening for CodeGirl: 
"Join high school-aged girls from around the world as they try to better their 
community through technology and collaboration in this thrilling, heartfelt 
documentary."

By 2017, the app market will be valued at $77 Billion. Over 80% of these 
developers are male. The Technovation Challenge aims to change that by 
empowering girls worldwide to develop apps for an international competition. 
From rural Moldova to urban Brazil to suburban Massachusetts, CODEGIRL follows 
teams who dream of holding their own in the worldâ€™s fastest-growing industry. 
The winning team gets $10K to complete and release their app, but every girl 
discovers something valuable along the way.
