Nervous about starting life at UWaterloo? Join us on our IRC channel for some
online office hours where WiCS volunteers and alumna will answer your
questions!

We'll be available at the following times for you to drop in and chat:

+ **Mon. Sep. 7:** 2:00&ndash;3:00PM
+ **Thu. Sep. 10:** 2:00&ndash;3:00PM
+ **Fri. Sep. 11:** 12:00AM&ndash;1:00PM

Feel free to drop by outside these hours, too. We just can't guarantee someone
will be there to answer your questions.

## How do I use IRC? ##

If you don't have a preferred IRC client, don't worry. Just click on [this
link](http://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=wics); it will launch a chat window,
you select a username, and you'll be good to go! Please note that our IRC
channel is governed by our [Code of Conduct]({filename}/pages/code-of-conduct.md).

For more information about our IRC channel and how to use this chat protocol,
you can check out our [Contact Us]({filename}/pages/contact.md) page.

## What should I ask? ##

If you want to chat but you're not sure where to start, here's some sample
topics that I had lots of questions about when I was in my first year:

+ Out-of-province move-in
+ Getting involved
+ Advanced sections for Math/CS classes
+ Override forms/getting into classes without prereqs
+ Interesting out-of-faculty classes
+ Stuff to do off-campus and exploring the city
