Summary: WiCS and CSC are watching War Games in MC Comfy!

WiCS and the Computer Science Club are watching War Games in the MC Comfy 
Lounge!

War Games is this movie where these kids phone a computer and then the computer 
wants to nuke things. Cold war stuff. Nowadays computers won't let you do that, 
you have to SSH in instead.

We're bringing food. Gluten-free, vegetarian options available. Sandwiches, 
drinks, and popcorn!

Everyone welcome! Stop by!
