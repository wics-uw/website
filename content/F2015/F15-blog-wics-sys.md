Summary: Join our systems committee and learn about and help us maintain our Linux systems!

WiCS has a number of servers and office computers and while it may not have
been something you've thought about, maintaining our computer systems takes
work!

We'd love to introduce new people to administering and hacking on our network.
Never worked with the command line before? No problem! Absolutely **no
experience is required** to get involved. What you will need is enthusiasm,
curiosity, and a willingness to listen, proactively try new things, and ask
questions.

If you're interested:

1. Please let us know by [signing up as a "wics-sys
   volunteer."](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14VNYPU-AzeFwig8ZDAbGaDpdXrRhZmkEm8XK6baPK-g/viewform)
   This way, we have a record of your email.
2. [Join our IRC channel.]({filename}/pages/irc.md) IRC, [while
   old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#History), is
   the official communication channel of the Systems Committee, so you'll need
   to hop on our channel in order to keep up with all the action.
3. [Check out our GitLab issue
   tracker](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/wics/documentation/issues) by logging in
   with your Quest ID and password.

Hope to see you getting involved!
