Summary: Come learn about digital hardware and Arduino programming in this women-only workshop for beginners!

Technical Workshop Series: This event is generously sponsored by BlackBerry,
as part of our Technical Workshop Series. We will be hosting three workshops
over the next three terms focused on teaching technical skills in partnership
with BlackBerry. To learn more about our Technical Workshop Series and partnership with BlackBerry see our 
[sponsors page]({filename}/pages/sponsors.md)

We're pleased to announce Melissa Tedesco's hardware workshop! Melissa and a 
team of mentors will introduce you to building prototypes with digital hardware 
and the software needed to interact with it.

Do you know how to program, but don't even know where to start with the
hardware? Well, never fear, because WiCS is here! On November 7th, we will be
running a workshop on how to put together hardware components and program them
with an Arduino!  The cost of the workshop is just $10, which contributes 
towards the price of an Arduino, and you'll get to take whatever you've built 
home with you. We'll be teaching you how to program LEDs and other sensors with 
the board using an IDE so that you can get started on your very own project!

Registration is very limited and first-come first-served, so sign up as soon as
possible! We'll be accepting registrations until the workshop or until we sell 
out. [Register here.](https://goo.gl/KPN4nf)

Food will be provided.
