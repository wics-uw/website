summary: Come and join us in the Big CSters Discussion about balancing lifestyle

Some of us have had times when we think one aspect of our life is more important than the other, such as studying over hanging out with friends or being with family. However, we should be aware that everything plays a role for our well-being. We will be sharing some tips and strategies to balance your super-busy student life. Come and meet your fellow CSters!
Like previous events, dinner will be provided!
