Summary: Check our new mentorship event!

Hey! Do you want to get your resume critiqued, 
learn about grad school options or upper year course-selections? 
We are hosting a speed mentoring event just to provide 
first and second year women in CS with a chance to 
ask academic-related and industry-related questions, 
and get the best possible insight from mentors 
from different technology backgrounds.

We will be providing light refreshments and snacks 
(vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options will be available)!

Note: This event is [women-only]({filename}/pages/faq.md).
